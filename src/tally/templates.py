STARTER_MERCHANTS = '''# Tally Merchant Rules
#
# Expression-based rules for categorizing transactions.
# Tags are collected from ALL matching rules.
#
# RULE MATCHING (controlled by rule_mode in settings.yaml):
#   first_match (default) - First matching rule sets category. Order matters!
#   most_specific         - Most specific rule wins. More conditions = wins.
#
# Match expressions:
#   contains("X")     - Case-insensitive substring match
#   regex("pattern")  - Regex pattern match
#   normalized("X")   - Match ignoring spaces/hyphens/punctuation
#   anyof("A", "B")   - Match any of multiple patterns
#   startswith("X")   - Match only at beginning
#   fuzzy("X")        - Approximate matching (catches typos)
#   fuzzy("X", 0.85)  - Fuzzy with custom threshold (default 0.80)
#   amount > 100      - Amount conditions
#   month == 12       - Date component (month, year, day, weekday)
#   weekday == 0      - Day of week (0=Monday, 1=Tuesday, ... 6=Sunday)
#   date >= "2025-01-01"  - Date range
#
# You can combine conditions with 'and', 'or', 'not'
#
# Run: tally inspect <file> to see your transaction descriptions.
# Run: tally discover to find unknown merchants.

# === Special Tags ===
# These tags control how transactions appear in your spending report:
#
#   income   - Deposits, salary, interest (excluded from spending)
#   transfer - Account transfers, CC payments (excluded from spending)

# === Field Transforms (optional) ===
# Strip payment processor prefixes before matching:
# field.description = regex_replace(field.description, "^APLPAY\\s+", "")
# field.description = regex_replace(field.description, "^SQ\\s*\\*", "")

# === Variables (optional) ===
# is_large = amount > 500
# is_holiday = month >= 11 and month <= 12

STARTER_VIEWS = '''# Tally Views Configuration (.rules format)
#
# Views define groups of merchants for your spending report.
# Each merchant is evaluated against all view filters.
# Views can overlap - the same merchant can appear in multiple views.
#
# SYNTAX:
#   [View Name]
#   description: Human-readable description (optional)
#   filter: <expression>
#
# PRIMITIVES:
#   months      - count of unique months with transactions
#   total       - sum of all payments
#   cv          - coefficient of variation of monthly totals (0 = very consistent)
#   category    - category string (e.g., "Food", "Travel")
#   subcategory - subcategory string (e.g., "Grocery", "Airline")
#   merchant    - merchant name
#   tags        - set of tag strings
#   payments    - list of payment amounts
#
# FUNCTIONS:
#   sum(x), count(x), avg(x), min(x), max(x), stddev(x)
#   abs(x), round(x)
#   by(field) - group payments by: month, year, week, day
#
# GROUPING:
#   by("month")           - list of payment lists per month
#   sum(by("month"))      - list of monthly totals
#   avg(sum(by("month"))) - average monthly spend
